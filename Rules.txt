Rules of HK Mahjong

Setup:
    Tiles are shuffled face down on the table.
    Each player will create a wall of tiles in front of them, 18 wide and 2 high
    Roll dice to determine who goes first
    Highest roll becomes the East wind, then going to South, West, and North counterclockwise
    Turn order is counterclockwise starting from East
    The starting wind is East, and the indicator is given to the East seat
    The East seat rolls the dice to determine which wall to break first, excluding himself
    From the left of the wall from the perspective of the wall's builder, 
        count the dice-roll-number of tiles from the left and break from there
    Each player will take 4 tiles at a time until everyone has 12 tiles
    The East player will then draw a tile from the wall and then skip over one tile and take a 14th tile
    The remaining players will then draw their 13th tile in order
    The East player then discards a tile, and the game begins

To win in Mahjong, your hand must contain satisfy certain win conditions
    Most win condition hands contain 4 triplets and a pair
    A triplet can either be three-of-a-kind of one tile, or a straight of three consecutive numbers, suited
    A three-of-a-kind is called a 'pung', and a three-straight is called a 'chi'
    It is possible to reach a four-of-a-kind, known as a 'kong'
    There are other winning hands that don't follow the above model, more on those later

A turn in Mahjong consists of drawing a tile from the wall (in the order the tiles were dealt)
    The player will then choose a tile in his/her hand to discard into the middle of the table
If a discarded tile can be used by another player to complete a pung:
    That other player can call 'pung' and take the tile and use it to complete the pung
    The tiles used in the pung are then placed in front of the player, face up
    The stealing player then discards a tile, and play resumes from the stealing player's position
    Some players' turns may be skipped because of this
If a discarded tile can be used by another player to complete a chi:
    The discarded tile can only be taken if it was discarded by the player to the left
    That is, chi tiles can only be taken from the preceding player in turn order
    The tiles used in the chi are then placed in front of the player, face up
    If 'chi' and 'pung' is called on the same discard, then 'pung' has precedence
    If 'chi' is called by multiple players on the same tile, then the first to do so wins

The only time tiles are laid in front of a player is if that player steals a discard from another player
    If a pung or chi is self-drawn from the wall, they do not need to reveal their tiles
    Therefore, it is possible to steal a tile as a 'kong', which works similarly to calling 'pung'
When taking a tile to complete a 'kong', an extra tile is drawn from the back of the wall
    A tile is then discarded as normal
If a player has laid a pung of tiles in front of them and then draws the 4th:
    That player can choose to complete the kong and draw another tile form the back of the wall
    This action can occur at any time, but only if the tile was self drawn
If a flower/season tile is ever drawn, it is immediately placed in front of the player who drew it
    A replacement tile from the back of the wall is then drawn, and play continues as normal
    Flowers and seasons are used for bonus points, more on scoring later

Points are awarded to the winning player based on their winning hand, plus flower/season tiles
    Because some winning hands are easier to achieve than others, they are worth fewer points
    For example, a hand containing only chi and a pair is worth less than one of all pungs and a pair
    Points can only be earned each round by the player with the winning hand
In addition to points awarded from the hand, additional points can be earned through other factors
    For example, if the winning tile was drawn by the winning player himself, an extra point is earned
    If the winning tile was used to complete a chi and was the middle tile, an extra point is earned
    The wind indicator also shows how extra points can be earned
        A pung of the prevailing wind is worth an additional point
        A pung of your seat wind is worth an additional point
        If the player's seat wind is also the prevailing wind, he/she can obtain both of these bonuses
        Every four rounds, the wind changes to the next wind in seating order (E, S, W, N, E)
    A pung of any of the three dragons is worth an additional point

If a player discards a tile that is stolen by another player to win the game, then they lose points equal
    to half of the winning hand's value, rounded down (excluding flowers)

Play continues until a player reaches a certain point goal, and is then determined the winner of the game
Rules can be modified to suit players' needs
